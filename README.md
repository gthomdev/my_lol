# my_lol

my_lol is a Flask application that I have created to meet the requirements of the Final Project task of [CS50](https://www.edx.org/course/cs50s-introduction-to-computer-science).

The aim of the application is to allow users to register an account and associate a summoner name, or summoner names with their account.

The application should then allow them to view their match history on that account. With Riot's APIs there are many options further down the line for this to be developed to do things like showing users their statistics for each champion, for each role, or in each season.

## Dependencies

All dependencies can be viewed in the requirements.txt file.

## Environment Variables

Environment variables are called via the dotenv Python library. The actual .env file I use is not in the repo as it would contain sensitive information. An example .env file has been included which lists the keys that you would have to fill in in order to set it up to use yourself.

You can get a Riot Developer API key which is essential for this project from Riot at their [Developer hub](https://developer.riotgames.com/).

## API Documentation

The APIs that are used are well documented by Riot in their [Developer hub](https://developer.riotgames.com/).
